# ember-light-table-addon

> The official [ember-cli blueprint](https://ember-cli.com/extending/#generators-and-blueprints) for initializing a new [**ember-light-table**][elt] addon


## :ledger: Usage

To create a new addon, just run:

```
ember addon <addon-name> -b ember-light-table-addon --yarn
```

`<addon-name>` can be whatever you like, but we strongly recommend to follow the
`ember-light-table-<something>` naming pattern.

This will create an addon that [looks just like this example][example].


## Status

This blueprint is still in development and should not be used yet.
